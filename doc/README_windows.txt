PCoin Core
=============

Intro
-----
Pcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run litecoin-qt.exe.

PCoin Core is the original PCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of PCoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or more. Make sure you
know the IP address of a Pcoin user in case the founding node (the main node of the
network which is owned by the developer) is down.

Pcoin uses the Litecoin source code for maximum mining efficiency.
